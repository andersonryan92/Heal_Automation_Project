# Heal_Automation_Project

Project Information:

I created a simple test case that creates an account on the heal.com website which is located at
/src/test/java/TestClass.java

I used the Page Object Model pattern to abstract away test details into separate classes

The project is structed with one test class file and 5 page object class files

At the end of the test I included an assertion that verifies that the browser is on the correct URL
(meaning that the account creation was successful)
